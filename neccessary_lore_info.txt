Some wizard had an apprentice named Ildari -  she was a very ambitious sorceress, arrogant and focused solely on her aims. The wizard was researching something referred to as an "heart stone" - a special kind of stone that had its origin in volcano, in which was hidden the heart of a slaughtered god. He held a belief that when placed in someone's chest, it can provide someone almost godlike powers. He wanted to tap into them himself, but it was much wiser to try it out on someone first... and that happened to be his apprentice (it's not clear in the game whether she did it willingly or didn't had the chance to object). The experiment failed. Ildari didn't survive and she was buried in a grave. But the heart did work eventually... but it had very drastic side effects.
