    # he suggests that some people after specific injuries are mentally ill
    # imperial says we should lock her up
    # breton argues that pleasant, non-intrusive behavior keeps things peaceful
    # those people are usually harmless

    # “once people are insane, you can’t be really friends with them”
    # “their mind is constantly in another state you can’t even imagine”
    # “they are not responsible for their actions and their feelings”
